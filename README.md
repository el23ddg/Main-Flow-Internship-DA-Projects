# Main-Flow-Internship-DA-Projects
These are the projects that I worked on when I was doing an internship with Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt Ltd
## Task 1 
### üéì Student Performance Analysis
This project analyzes student performance data using Python, focusing on factors influencing final grades (G3). It includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations for insights.
#### üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values with the median and removed duplicates.
- Exploratory Data Analysis:
- 1) Distribution of final grades (Histogram).
- 2) Study time vs. final grade (Scatter plot).
- 3) Average final grades by gender (Bar chart).
- Insights:
- 1) Weak correlation between study time and final grades.
- 2) Minor differences in performance across genders.
#### üöÄ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
#### üìä Visualizations
Clear and informative charts for easy interpretation of student performance trends.
## Task 2 
### Data Analysis and Sales Performance Projects
#### Project 1: General EDA (store_sales.csv)
Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and anomalies. Key tasks:
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and detected outliers using IQR and Z-scores.
- Statistical Analysis: Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and correlations to understand relationships.
- Visualizations: Histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to showcase distributions and correlations.
Deliverables:
- Cleaned dataset and insightful visualizations.
- A report highlighting patterns and relationships.
### Project 2: Sales Performance Analysis (Ecommerce_Sales.csv)
Analyzed sales data to identify key factors driving performance. Key tasks:
- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and converted dates to datetime for time-series analysis.
- EDA:
1) Time series plots to track sales trends.
2) Scatter plots for Profit vs. Discount relationships.
3) Charts for sales distribution by Region and Category.
- Predictive Modeling: Built a Linear Regression model to predict sales using Profit and Discount, evaluated with MSE and R¬≤ scores.
Deliverables:
- Visualizations of trends and sales patterns.
- A predictive model with actionable insights to improve sales performance.
